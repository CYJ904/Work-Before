We use the dataset from [E-commerce dataset by Olist (SQLite)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terencicp/e-commerce-dataset-by-olist-as-an-sqlite-database) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). The license of the dataset is "Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International". So, we shouldn't violate any intellectual property law when we use it for the project in CMPSC 431W, which is seen as academic usage purpose. We trim the dataset to avoid some potential problems.
